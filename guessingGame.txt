Text items file for the code-guessing program.
========================================
Program Description
This is a guessing-game program. In the usual case the computer will first
choose a random 4-digit integer containing only digits in the range 1..8.
Repetition of digits is allowed. This is the computer's "secret code".

The user will then have up to 10 chances to guess this secret code. Each guess
the user makes is scored by the computer against the computer's secret code,
and the user is then informed of that score. The user can use this scoring
information to help with subsequent guesses.

Each score computed by the program consists of exactly two digits:

- The first digit indicates the number of digits in the user's guess that
  exactly match the digits in the computer's secret code. To be an exact match,
  the digits must be the same and also be in the same position in the code.

- The second digit counts the number of digits in the user's guess that are
  the same as a digit in the computer's secret code, but are not in the same
  position. In this count, any digit in the guess must be compared with only
  one instance of itself in the computer's code.
        
Thus a perfect score is 40, and 00 indicates no matches at all.

                                                                 Screen 1 of 2
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And, for example, if the secret code is 6234 and the user's guess is 5266, the
score is 11. The first 1 counts the digit 2, which is an exact match, and the
second 1 counts one of the 6's in the user's guess, which is the same as the
one 6 in the secret code.
        
For purposes of testing and/or practice, the program also allows the user to
enter the secret code, which will therefore not be a secret at all. This
will, however, permit the user to verfify the scores computed by the program
as they are displayed.
        
If the user enters such a secret code, a check is made to make sure the code
is a valid one. Otherwise, an appropriate message is displayed and the program
terminates. No other error checking is performed.
